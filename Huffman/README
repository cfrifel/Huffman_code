Compression Ratio = .66, .63, .61
The compression on average is about .63

Instructions to compile

	1.	make

Using the scripts to compress a file:

	1.	./compress367 <filename>
	
		NOTE: The compressed file will have an output of the format <filename>.367

Using the scripts to decompress a file:

	1.	./decompress367 <filename>.367

		NOTE:	The decompressed file will have an output of the format <filename>

Steps to compress/decompress without using the scripts:

	1:	make
	2:	./frequency367 <data file> <frequency file>
			
		NOTES:	<data file> is the file to be compressed
			<frequency file> is the desired output name

	3:	./createcode367 <frequency file> <codebook file>

		NOTES:	<frequency file> is the output of frequency367
			<codebook file> is the desired output name

	4:	./encode367 <codebook file> <data file> <compressed data file>

		NOTES:	<codebook file> is the output of createcode367
			<data file> is the file to be compressed
			<compressed data file> is the desired output name

	5:	./decode367 <codebook file> <compressed data file> <uncompressed data file>

		NOTES:	<codebook file> is the output of createcode367
			<compressed data file> is the output of encode367
			<uncompressed data file> is the desired output name.  This should be
						your uncompressed file name.
